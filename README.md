Technologies Used: HTML CSS JavaScript

Challenges Faced:
1. Growing of snake body --> Took quite some time to come up with an array to store the previous positions
2. Collision detection --> I was using grid, which means my cells on the edge of the board continued on to the next row. 

Things I learnt:
- How to structure the code
- Thinking logically
- Just be creative!

Next Steps:
- Improve the game design using CSS
- Different game modes (countdown timer, multiplayer etc)
