# Technologies Used: 
HTML   
CSS   
JavaScript

# Challenges Faced:
1. Growing of snake body --> Took quite some time to come up with an array to store the previous positions
2. Collision detection --> I was using grid, which means my cells on the edge of the board continued on to the next row.

# How it can be improved:
- requestAnimationFrame for a smoother gameplay
- use of coordinates instead of grid for easier boundary conditions
- snake array to contain previous positions instead of '1's

# Things I learnt:
- How to structure the code by different sections
- Breaking down problems into small steps
- Just be creative!

# Next Steps:
- Improve the game design using CSS
- Different game modes (countdown timer, leaderboard etc)
